// for (; expression;)
// the loop header is equivalent to while (expression).The loop body is executed as long as the test expression is true.

// for (;;)
// This statement causes an infinite loop, since the controlling expression is assumed to be true if expression2 is missing.In the following

// he comma operator has the lowest precedence of all operators â€” even lower than
//  the assignment operators

// Loops can be nested, that is, the loop body can also contain a loop.The ANSI standard stipulates a maximum depth of 256 nested loops.
