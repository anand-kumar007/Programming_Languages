/*
 * all the operators are same as of C++ and all control statements as well
 * 
 * plus java supports three form of for loop
 * 
 * 1. simple one 2. for-each OR enhanced loop just like range based for loop in
 * c++ used with array or collections in java
 * 
 * 3. labelled for loop not recommended like label and goto in c++ used if we
 * have nested for loops we can se break aa; etc
